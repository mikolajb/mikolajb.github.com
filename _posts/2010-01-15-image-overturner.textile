title: Webrick proxy image overturner
---

For a first post, lets start from a joke - proxy which overtuns images.

Needed tools:
* Ruby
* Proxy - "Webric":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/index.html - the most avilable (included in ruby stdlib).
* Image library - "RMagick":http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/ - ruby wrapper to ImageMagick

<div class="code">
     <script src="http://gist.github.com/277636.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
</div>

Set proxy to:
* host: http://localhost
* port: 9090

and enjoy waching overturned images :)
